<h1>Ayla Android SDK</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
    The Ayla Android SDK is designed to expedite and simplify the use of Ayla connected wireless
    devices.
    To initialize the library, your application must call AylaNetworks.init() before any other
    AylaNetworks library call. There are many implementation examples provided in the supplied
    sample application, &quot;Aura&quot;, and unit tests. The Getting Started Guides are
    also provided to jump-start your project.
</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>
    To use the Ayla Mobile SDK for Android, the following steps should be taken:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create and initialize an instance of {@link AylaSystemSettings} filled out with your
        application&apos;s specific information
    </li>
    <li>Call {@link AylaNetworks#init AylaNetworks.init()} with the application's {@link
        AylaSystemSettings}</li>
    <li>Sign the user in using {@link AylaLoginManager#signIn AylaLoginManager.signIn()}</li>
    <li>Listen for {@link AylaSessionManager} events by creating an {@link AylaSessionListener}
        and callng {@link AylaSessionManager#addListener addListener()}
    </li>
    <li>Listen for {@link AylaDeviceManager} events by creating a {@link
        AylaDeviceManagerListener} and calling {@link AylaDeviceManager#addListener addListener}
    </li>
    <li>Wait for the {@link AylaDeviceManager.DeviceManagerListener#deviceManagerInitComplete
        deviceManagerInitComplete}
        notification indicating that the device list has been obtained and is up-to-date
    </li>
    <li>Create an {@link AylaDevice.DeviceChangeListener} to listen for changes
        to {@link AylaDevice} objects
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
Once these steps have been taken, the Ayla Mobile SDK will automatically monitor the list of
devices and keep their states up-to-date. Listeners will be notified of changes asynchronously
and can update the user interface appropriately.
</p>
<p>
    Devices may be controlled by creating {@link AylaDatapoint} objects for the device's {@link
    AylaProperty} by calling {@link AylaProperty#createDatapoint createDatapoint}. The specific
    behavior of devices is up to the manufacturer. Properties may be used both to control devices
    (write) or get status from devices (read). The SDK will keep all managed properties up-to-date
    automatically and will notify any listeners of changes when they occur.
</p>
<p>
    The SDK will manage properties that are important to the application. These properties are
    made known to the SDK via the {@link AylaSystemSettings.DeviceDetailProvider}, an object
    provided to the SDK by the application in the {@link AylaSystemSettings} provided to {@link
    AylaNetworks#initialize AylaNetworks.initialize()}. The SDK will call the {@link
    AylaSystemSettings.DeviceDetailProvider#getManagedPropertyNames} method for each device it is
    managing. If this method returns null for a device, the set of all properties returned from
    the service will be used. Most devices only need to pay attention to a subset of properties
    that may exist on the device. Implementing this method allows the SDK to be more efficient by
    only monitoring the set of properties that are important for a particular device.
</p>
<p>
    API documentation may be generated using JavaDoc or Doxygen. JavaDoc may be built using
    Android Studio or the command line:
    <pre>
    gradle generateDebugJavadoc
    </pre>
</p>
<p>
Doxygen users may use the pre-defined Doxyfile residing in the doc directory at the root of the
SDK project.
</p>
<h2>Aura: Sample application</h2>
Aura, available as a separate repository for SDK customers, provides a simple example of how to
use the Ayla Mobile SDK in a real application. Aura shows how to initialize the SDK, create a
{@link AylaSystemSettings.DeviceDetailProvider DeviceDetailProvider} set up to return property
names for the Ayla EVB development board and Generic Gateway solutions, listen for {@link
AylaSessionManager}, {@link AylaDevice} and {@link AylaDeviceManager} events to keep the UI up to
date, display {@link AylaProperty} lists and values for each device, toggle boolean {@link
AylaProperty} datapoints, view and edit {@link AylaUser} account information and more.
<h2>More Information</h2>
<ul>
    <li>{@link AylaSchedule} objects are used to manage schedules on {@link AylaDevice} objects</li>
    <li>The {@link AylaUser} object may be fetched from {@link AylaSessionManager} by calling
        {@link AylaSessionManager#fetchUserProfile fetchUserProfile()}</li>
    <li>{@link AylaContact}s may be created and used as references in {@link
        AylaDeviceNotificationApp}s and {@link AylaPropertyTriggerApp}s</li>
    <li>{@link AylaDevice} objects may be shared by calling {@link AylaDevice#shareWithEmail
        shareWithEmail()}</li>
</ul>
